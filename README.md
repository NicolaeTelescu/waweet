# Waweet
Waweet is a web app where users review food. Here you can discover new food that you like or add some that perhaps no one has ever seen.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Requirements
- Node.js
- MongoDB
<br/><br/>

## First use:
For first use you have to seed the database like so:
```
npm run-script seedDB
```

After seeing the message \"DB has been filled with success\" you can close the command and start the server.
<br/><br/>

## Start the server with:
```
npm start
```

Now you can enter \"localhost:3000\" and your application should be running.
